# A real-time visualisation example using highcharts.js with Shiny

The example also demonstrates how to send messages to the client from a server.R file giving way to possibilites using JS with Shiny. The example uses a real-time visualisation generated by random data points.

**Intentional snapshot:** the logic and style are kept as-was to reflect how I worked back in 2016.

## What’s here
- `app.R` – tiny launcher that sources `ui.R` and `server.R` without altering their logic
- `ui.R` / `server.R` – original Shiny app files (preserved)
- `www/realCharts.js` – JavaScript used by the app (moved to the Shiny-conventional `www/` folder)
- `docs/` – (optional) screenshots or notes

## Run it
```r
# in R
install.packages(c("shiny"))
# highcharter is NOT required here because this example uses Highcharts.js directly.
# Run the app:
shiny::runApp(".")
```

## About Highcharts

Highcharts is a JavaScript charting library (SVG-based) with rich interactivity. `{highcharter}` R package is available and easier to use in R but this example showcases using JS with R. I also found that this approach exposed more Highchart features as you ar working direclty with the native code.

## Snapshot Ethos

This repo is part of a series I’m keeping as historical snapshots. I’ve not modernized the app or refactored the code beyond:
